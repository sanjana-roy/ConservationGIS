# Floodplain Forests

This layer represents the existing floodplain forests in and around the town of Middlebury, inclusive of tree cover, grass and shrubs, and water. Floodplain forest communities are one of the most threatened ecosystems across the world due to the healthy and productive soils they occupy, which are highly desired for agricultural purposes. Therefore, the greatest conflict with floodplain forest conservation and restoration is the presence of agriculture on lands that consist of historic floodplain forests extent, which has left these communities in a very fragmented state along rivers and streams.

### Goals:
Looking ahead, the primary goals for floodplain forest conservation are:
1. To consider protections for existing floodplain forest communities
2. To promote the connection of floodplain forest blocks along rivers and streams
3. To negotiate agricultural land transformations to allow for floodplain forest restoration

### Results Highlights:

#### 1. Existing floodplain forests are fragmented
Current floodplain forest extents mostly include very narrow strips of floodplain forest communities along rivers that are largely on the East side of the Otter Creek River.

#### 2. Agriculture has been the main land development on historic floodplain forest extents

A large percentage of historic floodplain forests has been converted to agricultural lands. This demonstrates how agriculture as a land use is preferred over the development of infrastructure as floodplain forest soils are highly valuable for farming practices.

#### 3. Prime agricultural soils are often not in direct conflict with floodplain forests

The majority of historic and current floodplain forests do not in fact overlap with prime agricultural soils. The low gradient of the Otter Creek river leads to a lower deposition rate of fine sediment, which forms prime soil types. This demonstrates to us prime agricultural soils are often not in direct conflict with floodplain forests around Middlebury and therefore, agricultural lands that don't hold prime soils may be able to concede some of their land for floodplain forest restoration.

#### 4. The majority of floodplain forest communities can be conserved through the protection of riparian connectors
The majority (Historic: 60%, Current: 96%) of floodplain forest habitat remains unprotected and much of the historic floodplain forest land is under agricultural protection or just agricultural lands (as we also saw in the 2nd Result). However, a significant portion of current and historic extents can be protected under the conservation of habitat blocks, river corridors, and riparian connectors. The protection of riparian connectors (which include river corridors and flood zones) appears to cover most of floodplain forest extents and therefore, would be the most effective in its conservation (as shown in the map below).

### Known Limitations:
- Our analysis did not consider floodplain forests along lakes, which form a category under different types of floodplain forest communities in Vermont
- Our identification of current and historic extents of floodplain forests was entirely based off of the soils layer from which we derived the different natural community types. We identified natural communities as formations through these different soil types which may have restricted our spatial understanding of these communities.

### Further Work:
- Identifying which specific floodplain forest communities are within Middlebury, including floodplain forests around lakes, and what their conservation needs are
- Identifying floodplain forests through means other than just soils identification, but perhaps through conducting field work with ecologists
- Considering other land-based criteria in our analysis that farmers find value in for agricultural practices
- Identifying which agricultural land parcels can work to conduct floodplain forest restoration
